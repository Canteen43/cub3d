# Cub3D - Pokemon Edition

A Pokemon-themed 3D raycasting game engine built in C using miniLibX, featuring first-person exploration with bonus features like minimap, sprites, and interactive elements. Developed in collaboration with Gabe Levin.

## Overview

## Features

### Core Features
- **3D Raycasting Engine:** Real-time 3D rendering using raycasting algorithms
- **First-Person Navigation:** WASD movement and mouse look controls
- **Wall Textures:** Pokemon-themed wall textures for immersive environments
- **Ceiling and Floor:** Textured ceiling and floor rendering

### Bonus Features
- **Minimap:** Real-time minimap showing player position and surroundings
