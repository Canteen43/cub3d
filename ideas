Wall height and field of view:
Projected Height=Wall Height × Projection Plane Distance​ / Distance to Wall

Projection Plane Distance= Screen Width​ / 2⋅tan(FOV/2)

Angles: Sine notation instead of degrees. type: double (for precision)

Coordinates: floats (for easier computation)

Project Plan:
1 Super simple design for mandatory part to get the math working.
2 Nice design for bonus.
